### Integration of Medical Imaging Systems Course Experiments
## Overview
This repository contains the code and results for five experiments conducted as part of the Integration of Medical Imaging Systems course. The experiments focus on applying various image processing techniques such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT), and Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) on DICOM images of various human anatomy parts. Additionally, the experiments include projecting images and performing back projection.
